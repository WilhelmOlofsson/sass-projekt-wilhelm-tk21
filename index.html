       <p>The capybara or greater capybara is a giant cavy rodent 
        native to South America. It is the largest living 
        rodent and a member of the genus Hydrochoerus. 
        The only other extant member is the lesser capybara. 
        Its close relatives include guinea pigs and rock cavies, and it 
        is more distantly related to the agouti, the chinchilla, 
        and the nutria. The capybara inhabits savannas and dense 
        forests, and lives near bodies of water. It is a highly 
        social species and can be found in groups as large as 
        100 individuals, but usually live in groups of 10 to 20 individuals. 
        The capybara is hunted for its meat and hide and also for grease 
        from its thick fatty skin. It is not considered a threatened species..</p>
